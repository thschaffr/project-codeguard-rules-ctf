# Software Security Skill (Project CodeGuard)
This skill provides comprehensive security guidance to help AI coding agents generate secure code and prevent common vulnerabilities. It is based on **Project CodeGuard**, an open-source, model-agnostic security framework that embeds secure-by-default practices into AI coding workflows.

## When to Use This Skill
This skill should be activated when:
- Writing new code in any language
- Reviewing or modifying existing code
- Implementing security-sensitive features (authentication, cryptography, data handling, etc.)
- Working with user input, databases, APIs, or external services
- Configuring cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, or containers
- Handling sensitive data, credentials, or cryptographic operations

## How to Use This Skill

### 1. MANDATORY EXECUTION PROTOCOL (File Discovery)
**Step 1: Construct File Search Command**
You MUST construct a file search command (e.g., `find`) that explicitly includes ALL file extensions listed in the table below.
- **DO NOT** use a default list of extensions.
- **DO NOT** skip "non-code" files like `.css`, `.xml`, or `.yaml`.
- **EXAMPLE**: If the table lists `css` with extensions `.css`, your find command MUST include `-name "*.css"`.

**Step 2: Mandatory Analysis**
For EVERY file found that matches a language in the table:
1. You **MUST READ** the content of the file to perform the security check.
2. You **MUST APPLY** the specific rules listed in the table for that file type.
3. **DO NOT SKIP** files just because they are stylesheets, templates, or config files.
4. **DO NOT ASSUME** a file is safe based on its name or extension alone.

### 2. Rule Application
When writing or reviewing code:

**A. Always-Apply Rules**
Some rules MUST be checked on every code operation:
- `codeguard-1-hardcoded-credentials.md` - Never hardcode secrets, passwords, API keys, or tokens
- `codeguard-1-crypto-algorithms.md` - Use only modern, secure cryptographic algorithms
- `codeguard-1-digital-certificates.md` - Validate and manage digital certificates securely

**B. Context-Specific Rules**
Apply rules from /rules directory based on the language of the feature being implemented using the table given below:
<!-- LANGUAGE_MAPPINGS_START -->
<!-- LANGUAGE_MAPPINGS_END -->

### 3. Proactive Security
Don't just avoid vulnerabilities-actively implement secure patterns:
- Use parameterized queries for database access
- Validate and sanitize all user input
- Apply least-privilege principles
- Use modern cryptographic algorithms and libraries
- Implement defense-in-depth strategies

## CodeGuard Security Rules
The security rules are available in the `rules/` directory.

### Usage Workflow
When generating or reviewing code, follow this workflow:

### 1. Initial Security Check
Before writing any code:
- Check: Will this handle credentials? → Apply codeguard-1-hardcoded-credentials
- Check: What language am I using? → Identify applicable language-specific rules
- Check: What security domains are involved? → Load relevant rule files

### 2. Code Generation
While writing code:
- Apply secure-by-default patterns from relevant Project CodeGuard rules
- Add security-relevant comments explaining choices

### 3. Security Review
After writing code:
- Review against implementation checklists in each rule
- Verify no hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Validate that all the rules have been successfully followed when applicable.
- Explain which security rules were applied
- Highlight security features implemented
